Insertion Sort

Example 1

Array List = [22,27,16,2,18,6]

Step 1
[2,27,16,22,18,6]

Step 2
[2,6,16,22,18,27]

Step 3-4-5
[2,6,16,18,22,27]

Big-O = O(n)

Time Complexity = Worst case


Example 2 (first 4 steps)

Array List = [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

Step 1
[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]

Step 2
[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]

Step 3
[2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]

Step 4
[2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
